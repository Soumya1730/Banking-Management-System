# Banking Management System (C++)

## 📌 Overview
This project is a **Banking Management System** implemented in **C++**.  
It simulates basic banking operations such as creating an account, depositing money, withdrawing money, checking balance, closing an account, and displaying all accounts.

All data is stored in a file (`Bank.data`) so that the system maintains account information even after the program is closed.

- Deposit money into an account  
- Withdraw money (with a minimum balance check)  
- Check account balance  
- Close an existing account  
- Display all existing accounts
